# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! This includes suggestions for new features, changes in the direction
of the app, and anything in between. If you are looking to contribute, and feel something could be done
in a better way using something outside of the stack in this project, feel free to bring it up!

## Before you create a PRâ€¦
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/brombomb/f1hub/issues) first or ask to contribute on an existing one to discuss your idea with the maintainer(s). After we've chatted things through, go ahead with your work and send over a PR.

## Branches
Please create a feature branch with your changes in the format: `[fix/feature/etc]/[description]` -- this helps to gauge what the branch is for later on.
Once your work is done create a pull request and the maintainers will check the changes and take further actions.
